# ðŸ“š Sem-3_DSA_Assignment

This repository includes individual assignments from Semester 3 Data Structures and Algorithms coursework, covering different DSA concepts.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure 

Each folder contains specific program files, each with its own DSA focus.

- **Assignment- 1** - Programs showcasing insertion & deletion operations at any position in arrays.
- **Assignment- 2** - Demonstration of insertion of elements and searching them using different searching techniques. 
- **Assignment- 3** - Implementation of stack operations using array and switch case.
- **Assignment- 4** - Changing infix to postfix expression and sorting of elements of array using various sorting techniques.
- **Assignment- 5** - Execution of linear and circular queue data structures.
- **Assignment- 6** - Checking for the qualification for a sparse matrix and to reverse a string using stack data structure.
- **Assignment- 7** - Enactment of all basic functions of singly linked list. 
- **Assignment- 8** - Enactment of all basic functions of circular linked list.
- **Assignment- 1 using function** - Programs showcasing insertion & deletion operations at any position in arrays using functions.
